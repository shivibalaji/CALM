Dear Reader,
This repository only contains partial code information from the Comprehensive Assistive Language Model (CALM) project.

ChatGPT-4o is the primary component. It is instruction-tuned and prompt-tuned to modify the LLM's response generation to support neurodivergent language acquisition and appropriate age consideration. This was done with the help of the OpenAI Plus plan. The model is only available for conditional use. The intention is to make it publicly available as soon as the final minor improvements are made.

The Flan-T5 model by Google Deepmind was instruction-tuned and partially trained on HuggingFace, and the raw code was taken from **https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/v4.49.0/src/transformers/models/t5** and is partially attached here. 

GECToR was utilised from two GitHub repositories: **https://github.com/gotutiyan/gector** and **https://github.com/cofe-ai/fast-gector**. The exact instructions from the Gotutiyan repository were followed. Minor internal import updates are required for local/cloud usage, depending on compatibility. 


CALM is expected to function as a complete layered model, and the repository does NOT reflect the result. This is only used to share the sources and utilised code.
