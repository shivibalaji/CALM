Dear User,
This repository only contains partial code information from the Comprehensive Assistive Language Model (CALM) project.
ChatGPT-4o is the primary component, which is instruction and prompt tuned to modify the LLM's response generation to support neurodivergent language acquisition and appropriate age consideration. Cloud/Online operations.
The Flan-T5 model by Google Deepmind was instruction-tuned and partially trained on HuggingFace and the raw code is present here. 
GECToR was utilised from two github repositories: **https://github.com/gotutiyan/gector** and **https://github.com/cofe-ai/fast-gector** and the exact instructions from the Gotutiyan repository was followed. There are minor internal import updates required for local/cloud usage depending on the compatibility. 
CALM is expected to function as a complete layered model and the repository does NOT reflect the end result. This is only used to share the sources and utilised code.
