Dear User,
This repository only contains partial code information from the Comprehensive Assistive Language Model (CALM) project.

ChatGPT-4o is the primary component. It is instruction-tuned and prompt-tuned to modify the LLM's response generation to support neurodivergent language acquisition and appropriate age consideration. This was done with the help of the OpenAI Plus plan. The model at the moment is only available for conditional use. The intention is to make it publicly available as soon as the final minor improvements are made.

The Flan-T5 model by Google Deepmind was instruction-tuned and partially trained on HuggingFace and the raw code is present here. 

GECToR was utilised from two github repositories: **https://github.com/gotutiyan/gector** and **https://github.com/cofe-ai/fast-gector** and the exact instructions from the Gotutiyan repository was followed. There are minor internal import updates required for local/cloud usage depending on the compatibility. 


CALM is expected to function as a complete layered model and the repository does NOT reflect the end result. This is only used to share the sources and utilised code.
